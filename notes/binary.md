# Binary Numeral System

The **binary numeral system** is a base-2 numeral system that uses only two symbols: `0` and `1`. Each digit in a binary number is called a **bit**. This system is widely used in computing and digital electronics due to its straightforward representation of electrical states (on/off, true/false).

## Key Concepts:
- **Bit**: A single binary digit (either `0` or `1`).
- **Base-2**: Each digit represents an increasing power of 2, starting from the rightmost bit.
  
### Conversion Formula:
To convert binary to decimal, use the formula:

`Decimal = (bₙ × 2ⁿ) + (bₙ₋₁ × 2ⁿ⁻¹) + ... + (b₀ × 2⁰)`

Where `b` is a binary digit.
