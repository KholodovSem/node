# Conversion Between Binary and Hexadecimal

The binary and hexadecimal numeral systems are closely related, making conversions between them straightforward. Each hexadecimal digit corresponds to a group of four binary digits (bits).

## Binary to Hexadecimal Conversion

To convert binary to hexadecimal:
1. **Group the binary digits** into sets of four, starting from the right. Add leading zeros if necessary.
2. **Convert each group** to its hexadecimal equivalent.

### Example:
Convert the binary number `11011011` to hexadecimal.

1. Group into sets of four:
```
1101 | 1011
```

2. Convert each group:
- `1101` = D
- `1011` = B

So, `11011011` in binary is `DB` in hexadecimal.

## Hexadecimal to Binary Conversion

To convert hexadecimal to binary:
1. **Convert each hexadecimal digit** to its 4-bit binary equivalent.

### Example:
Convert the hexadecimal number `3F` to binary.

1. Convert each digit:
- `3` = `0011`
- `F` = `1111`

So, `3F` in hexadecimal is `00111111` in binary.

## Summary

- **Binary to Hexadecimal**: Group binary digits in sets of four and convert to hex.
- **Hexadecimal to Binary**: Convert each hex digit to a 4-bit binary number.
