# Character Encoding

**Character encoding** is a system that assigns a sequence of bytes (zeros and ones) to each character. This allows computers to represent and manipulate text.

## Key Concepts

- **ASCII**:
  - **7-bit encoding** (values from 0 to 127).
  - Covers only English letters, digits, punctuation marks, and control characters.
  
- **Unicode**:
  - A universal character encoding standard that supports a wide range of characters from all languages.
  - Various encodings:
    - **UTF-8**: 8-bit variable-length encoding, backward compatible with ASCII.
    - **UTF-16**: 16-bit encoding that can represent characters in two bytes.
    - **UTF-32**: 32-bit encoding that uses four bytes for each character.

## Summary

- Each character has its own numeric representation.
- ASCII is limited to English characters and basic symbols.
- Unicode provides a comprehensive solution for representing characters from all languages, enhancing global communication.
