# Hexadecimal Numeral System

The **hexadecimal numeral system** is a base-16 numeral system that uses sixteen distinct symbols: `0-9` for values zero to nine and `A-F` for values ten to fifteen. It is often abbreviated as **hex** and is commonly used in computing and digital electronics.

## Key Concepts:
- **Digit Symbols**: The symbols used in hexadecimal are `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F`.
- **Base-16**: Each digit represents an increasing power of 16, starting from the rightmost digit.

### Conversion Formula:
To convert hexadecimal to decimal, use the formula:

`Decimal = (hₙ × 16ⁿ) + (hₙ₋₁ × 16ⁿ⁻¹) + ... + (h₀ × 16⁰)`

Where `h` is a hexadecimal digit.
