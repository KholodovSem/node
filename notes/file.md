# What is a File?

A file is a structured sequence of bits, represented by ones and zeroes on a disk. It contains data that is given a name and managed by a file system. Without the file system, it would be impossible to differentiate between different types of data like text, images, or videos, as everything would appear as a continuous stream of bits.
